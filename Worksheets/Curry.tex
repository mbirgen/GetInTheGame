\worksheet{Shoot 3's like Steph Curry}
Things you will need"'
\begin{itemize}
	\item coin
	\item this worksheet
\end{itemize}

We're ready to play our game. Curry's results are locked in; he's made 11 of 13 three-point attempts. Now you need to take your 13 shots.
\vfill

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Flip a coin
	\item If you get heads, you make the shot; tails, you miss.
	\item Repeat the coin flip 13 times and keep track of your progress with the chart below. \vfill
	
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node at (0,0) {$\checkmark$};
		 \foreach \x in {1,...,13}{
       \node [inner sep=10pt, draw] at  (\x,0)  {};
       }
	\node at (0, -1) {\sffamily X};
		 \foreach \x in {1,...,13}{
       \node [inner sep=10pt, draw] at  (\x,-1)  {};
       }
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{enumerate}

Did you beat Steph by making more than 11 shots? If so, you are lucky. Play a couple more games:\vfill
	
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node at (0,0) {$\checkmark$};
		 \foreach \x in {1,...,13}{
       \node [inner sep=10pt, draw] at  (\x,0)  {};
       }
	\node at (0, -1) {\sffamily X};
		 \foreach \x in {1,...,13}{
       \node [inner sep=10pt, draw] at  (\x,-1)  {};
       }
	\end{tikzpicture}\vfill

	What is the average number of three point shots you are making in each game?
